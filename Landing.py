    ## Test description

    Welcome! Your valuable feedback on VRECS responses is crucial for enhancing its effectiveness. Below are the steps to follow:

    ### Task Instructions:
    1. You will be presented with an utterance and a dataset description. The total number of responses to evaluate are 20.
    2. Along with this, you will see two responses proposed for the given utterance, as in the example below.
    3. Your task is to rank each response on a scale from 1 to 5 based on how human-like or natural it sounds to you.
    4. Assign a score of 1 to the response that seems the least human-like or natural to you, and a score of 5 to the response that seems the most human-like or natural.
    5. You can assign scores between 1 and 5 to both responses, ensuring each response receives a unique score.
    6. Your ratings will help us assess the effectiveness of various language generation models.

    ### Score description:
    1 - Completely Meaningless: Indicates utter insignificance or lack of importance.
    2 - Mostly Meaningless: Implies minimal significance or relevance.
    3 - Beginning to Inform: Signifies the start of providing some information or significance.
    4 - Mostly Meaningful: Suggests considerable importance or relevance.
    5 - Completely Meaningful: Signifies utmost significance or profound relevance.

    Thank you for your participation and dedication to improving visual communication!

    The user is interested in understanding the average price of products in each category. Therefore, the 'product_category_code' is selected as the x-axis to represent different categories, and the 'product_price' is selected as the y-axis to represent the price of the products. The'mean' aggregate function is used to calculate the average price for each category. The data is then grouped by 'product_category_code' to calculate the average price for each category. This is a bar chart where the x-axis represents different product category codes and the y-axis represents the mean price of products in each category. The bars are grouped by product category code.
